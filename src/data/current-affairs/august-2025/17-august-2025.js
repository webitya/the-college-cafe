    summary:
      "Govt proposes to scrap 12% & 28% GST slabs, introducing simplified structure with 5%, 18%, <1% and 40% rates.",
    content:
      "The Centre has proposed a historic overhaul of the GST structure, scrapping the 12% and 28% slabs. The new system will primarily operate with four rates: 5%, 18%, a concessional rate of less than 1%, and a 40% 'sin tax' applicable to luxury and de-merit goods like tobacco and gutka. According to the proposal, 99% of items under the 12% bracket will shift to 5%, while 90% of items from 28% will move to 18%. No additional cess will be levied. The reforms aim to reduce the tax burden on the common man, simplify compliance, fix inverted duty structures, boost consumption, curb tax evasion, and expand the tax base, even if it means a short-term dip in revenue collection.",
