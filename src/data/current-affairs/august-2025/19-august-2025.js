    summary: "INDIA bloc plans motion against CEC Gyanesh Kumar over politically charged remarks; SC orders EC to publish Bihar voter roll details.",
    content:
      "The INDIA bloc has announced its plan to move a motion against Chief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, accusing him of making 'politically charged' remarks. The Congress alleged that his statements reflected the tone of a BJP leader rather than that of a neutral constitutional authority. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court has directed the Election Commission to publish details of 65 lakh voters excluded from the Bihar voter roll. However, legal challenges remain, as the 2023 law grants immunity to the CEC and Election Commissioners, making their removal process extremely difficult.",
